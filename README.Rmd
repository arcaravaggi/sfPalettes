sfPalettes is a library of colour palettes based on popular (and, perhaps, not so popular) science fiction movies. All colour palettes in this package were created using a number of publically available sources, including screenshots and posters. 

For an index of the palettes contained within the package, call the internal `mov` dataframe. For usage instructions, [click here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/arcaravaggi/sfPalettes/blob/master/vignettes/sfPalettes.html).

sfPalettes was inspired by Kartik Ram's [wesanderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) package.
